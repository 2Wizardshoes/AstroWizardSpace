                     Betelgeuse has shown unprecedented activity in recent years, transitioning from a state of extreme dullness to a remarkable surge in brightness, increasing its brightness by about 50 percent.

                     Speculation of a supernova intensifies whenever any alterations occur within this red supergiant star situated in the Orion constellation of the Milky Way galaxy.

                     Now, the eruption of Betelgeuse as a supernova is an undeniable eventuality. However, the uncertainty lies in determining when this will precisely occur, primarily due to the peculiar chemical processes unfolding deep within the star's core.

                     The majority of scientific studies have highlighted that it will not erupt in our lifetimes. However, a new controversial study predicts that it might happen within the next few decades.

                     The key to its explosion lies within the fuel it relies upon.
                     The element fueling the star holds the ability to forecast its eventual explosion as a supernova.

                     This is difficult for scientists to assess since they cannot see through the core of the star, where such fusion reactions occur.

                     In the latest study, which is uploaded on a pre-print server, the team stated: “Betelgeuse is in the late stage of core carbon burning, and a good candidate for the next Galactic supernova.”

                     Throughout its billions of years of existence, the red giant star has fused most of its hydrogen into helium. This study indicates that Betelgeuse has progressed beyond the stage where our Sun is and is no longer converting hydrogen into helium in its core.

                 <p>
                     Following this major sequence is the usage of carbon as a fuel source from its cores.

                     Not many experts agree with the results
                     However, the carbon-burning cycle is divided into many stages. As a result, predicting when Betelgeuse will go supernova is dependent on which of those carbon phases it is in. Unfortunately, at present, there is no conclusive evidence available regarding the star's current position within these carbon phases.

                     "In fact, it is not possible to determine the exact evolutionary stage, because surface conditions hardly change in the late stage close to the carbon exhaustion and beyond," the researchers write.

                 <h2>
                     What is a supernove?
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                     A supernova is an incredibly powerful and luminous explosion that occurs at the end of a star's life cycle. It is one of the most energetic events in the cosmos and can briefly outshine an entire galaxy.
                     There are two main types of supernovas: Type I and Type II.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Type II supernovas occur when a massive star, typically more than eight times the mass of our Sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel. As the star ages, nuclear reactions in its core produce heavier elements, like iron.
                     Eventually, the core becomes predominantly composed of iron, making it unable to sustain nuclear fusion. Without the energy that fusion provides, gravity takes over, causing the core to collapse rapidly.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     The core's collapse releases an enormous amount of energy, generating a shockwave that races outward, causing the outer layers of the star to explode violently. This explosion unleashes an immense burst of light and energy,
                     making the supernova visible across vast distances. The remnants of the star are scattered into space, enriching the surrounding interstellar medium with heavy elements.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     Type I supernovas, on the other hand, occur in binary star systems when a white dwarf, the remnant of a low-mass star, pulls matter from its companion star. If the white dwarf accumulates enough mass,
                     about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (known as the Chandrasekhar limit), electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support it against gravity. The resulting collapse triggers a runaway
                     thermonuclear reaction, causing the entire white dwarf to explode.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     During a supernova, elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, are synthesized and scattered into space. The expelled material enriches the interstellar medium, providing the building blocks for future
                     generations of stars, planets, and even life itself. Supernovas are not only crucial for the creation and distribution of heavy elements but also play a fundamental role in shaping the galaxies we see today.
